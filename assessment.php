                                If we talk about technical learnings in my OJT, I am confident to say that 
                                I learned and I gained a lot in Eastvantage. I love the path of Web Development, 
                                and in this company, I learned and improved my skills in that path.
                                </p>
                            
                                <p class="discription my-1" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
                                At first, I have zero knowledge in using any frameworks. But in here I learned to use ReactJS 
                                for front-end and Laravel API for backend. I improved my skills in using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                                I also learned how to use redux in ReactJS as well as using an AXIOS. I gained a knowledge 
                                in using a git and with this I learned how to work collaborate with other developers. 
                                I also learned how to apply algorithms in coding. There’s a task where I need to 
                                send an email, and my co-developer suggest that I used a mailtrap website 
                                for testing an email sending. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="discription my-1" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
                                I am just grateful in Eastvantage because they give me an opportunity to showcase my passion 
                                as well as give me an opportunity to learn things that are not taught to school. With the learnings I gained, 
                                I will use this as stepping stone for the next environment I will take.

                                Being in a good team makes the work easier. I confirmed this 
                                phrase when I am with the team of OPS Team of Ms. Carmela. 
                                I am grateful that I was belong with the team.

                                <p class="discription my-1" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
                               The team that I was belong has an atmosphere where you can’t feel 
                               the pressure and hassle. My Co-Developer is very approachable. They 
                               help us in every task where it sounds complicated. They offer a virtual 
                               tutorial just to help us. In my Co-Intern, I’m blessed to work with them, 
                               at the very least I didn’t feel alone with the team. They help me in every way 
                               they can. And in my supervisor, she is very friendly. I didn’t feel the pressure 
                               in every meeting we had. She appreciates every work we finished, and it really boost
                                my confident to continue my task with extra effort.
                                </p>

                                <p class="discription my-1" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
                                I can say that they are one of the people who help me to start my journey in real world. 
                                If I will give me a chance to work with them, I will accept it wholeheartedly.

                                   All the days in my training are memorable. But the most? Maybe the early days of my training. 
                                   That's the time where I feel nervous and I have zero confident with my knowledge.
                                   
                                </p>
                                <p class="discription my-1" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
                                  In my early days in OJT, I always sleep beyond midnight just to study the task given to me. But even I was in sleepless night, I didn't 
                                   feel the hassle because I feel excited and I love what I'm doing. The first task that was given to us was very hard. But based on our co-developer
                                   who give that task, he gave that specific task because it contains all the things we need before we start to code on the actual website.
                                   And he said that he wants to share to us how he code. It results that all the things in that task are very useful on our next tasks.
                                   
                                </p><p class="discription my-1" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
                                 I will not forget those days I had in my training. I know it will be very useful on the next journey I will take.

                                   Everything on the OJT Program of the company and the university is good, 
                                   but I think it will be better if atleast we have days where we can go to the company. 
                                   To experience the atmosphere on being in the real world. To learn things that is 
                                   better to teach in Face to face tutorial. And to experience some hands on task. But since 
                                   we're in pandemic and it is understandable.

                                   I also wants to  recommend that since we are in virtual internship, I think it is good to 
                                   consider the capability of the student in terms of materials. Especially on the gadgets, since
                                   we're Information Technology student, it is necessary to have materials that we need.

                                 For those people who will take their OJT in the near future, my first advice is that they need to think carefully
                                 what they really want after they graduated. Doing things that you don't like is likely you're just giving yourself a dim future.
                                 Because when the time comes that everything is not going smoothly, you will give up easily. But if you know what you really want, 
                                 your passion will drive you into success. 
                                   
                                </p>

                                <p class="discription my-1" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
                                  
                                 And when you know what you really want and you've been there. Do it extraordinarily. Give some time and effort when you're in the OJT.
                                 This training is not just a requirement, but this is a stepping stone to take for our next journey. Learn as much as you can in the training.
                                Our labor is not in vain, you will see the fruit of it.
